<h2> INTRODUCTION 나를 소개하다</h2>

<p>Hello. <strong>I'm <a href="https://www.naver.com/"
  target="_blank" title="naver"><u>SeoYoung</u></strong></a> and it is my first time learning coding.</p><p>
  I have a special episode of my name. My dad’s favorite poet is 피천득. The post is dead now and he had a daughter whose name is 서영.
  My dad named me after the daughter. So I became 서영.<br><img src="unsplash.jpg" width="200"></p><p>
This is my family. My parents, me and my younger sisters. My father is a CEO　of a  small company. He is nice, responsible and also emotional.
He likes to write lyrics and songs. And He is a leader of our church’s band and also a conductor of church choir. I’m so proud of him.
My mom is a housewife. She is devotional and very warm-hearted. Sometimes I think her concern is too much to handle, but I think she can’t fix it.</p>
